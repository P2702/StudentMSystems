  <h5 class="card-title text-bold text-primary">About Us</h5>
     <p class="card-text" style="text-align:justify;">Since 2009, We are engaged in activities to present good understanding about the subjects C, C++, Data Structure, Java (Core, Advance), Hibernate, Spring framework, Python, PHP, HTML, CSS, Java Script, SQL, PLSQL, Operating System, System Programming as well as BCS, BCA and BE. We keep our primary focus in cultivating ideology of knowledge based learning in all students around us, instead of curriculum based learning . We indulge our students in practical application based knowledge by coaching them build industry standard projects for their curriculum. We created a student friendly, android application specifically for our students and ex-students, along with limited features for any one willing to learn these languages and technologies. We have our alumni placed in many MNCs and numerous IT & Service related organisations.</p>
